<hr>
Spoofing is when a caller deliberately falsifies the information transmitted to your caller ID display to disguise their identity. Scammers often use neighbor spoofing so it appears that an incoming call is coming from a local number, or spoof a number from a company or a government agency that you may already know and trust. If you answer, they use scam scripts to try to steal your money or valuable personal information, which can be used in fraudulent activity.
The core concept of call spoofing may be simple, but scammers continue to evolve scams using spoofed numbers. Some of the most common call spoofing scams targeting consumers today include: 

Neighbor Spoofing
This technique has become ubiquitous â€“ scammers will use a telephone number that features the recipientâ€™s local area code, sometimes even mirroring the first several digits of the recipientâ€™s own number. Neighbor spoofing has historically been effective as it lures Americans into a false sense of familiarity with the number displayed on caller ID, making it more likely they will answer the call.  

Impersonation Spoofing
Fraudsters will spoof numbers belonging to known contacts or reputable organizations to execute scams such as: 

Bank Account Scams: Posing as bank representatives to extract private financial data.  
Government Scams: Posing as government officials to acquire sensitive personal information. 
Unpaid Tax Scams: Posing as IRS employees demanding payment for fictitious tax bills and threatening legal consequences. 
Tech Support Scams: Posing as IT providers scanning for issues with the recipientâ€™s computer in an attempt to install malware or steal information.
